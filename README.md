# Water-System
This is my first Arduino project so it is very basic and nothing fancy. If you have any suggestions let me know so I can make changes. I do not have very much expirence with Arduino or coding in general so I am always looking for feedback. 

First, there is a serial monitor test code file. This allows you to put the circuit together and test the indidviual components to ensure that everything is wired together correctly. 

The second file, this is the complete code and is simply in design. I have tried to make it user friendly and since it was my first project, I do not take credit for everything as I got lots of help in other Arduino forums with the coding.
