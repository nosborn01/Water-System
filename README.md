# Auto-Watering System

This is my first Arduino project, so it is very basic and nothing fancy. If you have any suggestions let me know so I can make changes. I do not have very much experience with Arduino or coding in general, so I am always looking for feedback. 

First, there is a serial monitor test code file. This allows you to put the circuit together and test the individual components to ensure that everything is wired together correctly. 

The second file, this is the complete code and is simply in design. I have tried to make it user friendly and since it was my first project, I do not take credit for everything as I got lots of help in other Arduino forums with the coding. 


### Parts:

First, let's list the parts that will be needed for the project:
  - Arduino Uno
  - USB A to B
  - 12 or 9 VDC Power supply
  - 12V Solenoid Valve 3/4"
  - Diode 1A/50V
  - LCD Display Screen 16x2 w/I2C backpack
  - Soil Moisture Sensor
  - 10K Ohm Resistors x 2
  - N Channel MOSFET 60V/30A
  - DHT22 Temp/Humidity Sensor
  - Breadboard Half Size
  - Jumper Wires M/F
  - Jumper Wires M/M
  - Soldering Iron w/ associated need materials

You could use a number of moisture sensors for your circuit, but I went with one from SparkFun (Mfr# SEN-13322). Most other parts can be selected from any manufacturer.

I have also provided a top over view of the circuit below, as some are not always the best at reading wiring diagrams.
